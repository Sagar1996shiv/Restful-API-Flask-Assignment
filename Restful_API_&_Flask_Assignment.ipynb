        "# Restful API & Flask\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is a RESTful API?\n",
        " - A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer API) is a type of web API that follows the principles of REST architecture, which is a set of constraints for building scalable web services. RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods to perform operations on resources, typically represented in formats like JSON or XML.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  Explain the concept of API specification?\n",
        " - An API specification is a detailed, formal document that defines how an API behaves and how developers can interact with it. It acts as a contract between the API provider and the API consumer, outlining exactly what requests are allowed, how they should be structured, and what responses to expect.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs?\n",
        " - Flask is a lightweight and flexible Python web framework that’s commonly used to build web applications and RESTful APIs. It's known for being simple, easy to get started with, and highly extensible.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why Flask is Popular for Building APIs:\n",
        "- Lightweight and Minimal\n",
        "Flask doesn’t force any particular project structure or tools, so you can build exactly what you need — no more, no less.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Easy to Learn and Use\n",
        "Its syntax and concepts are straightforward, making it ideal for beginners and quick development.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Excellent for RESTful APIs\n",
        "Flask makes it easy to define endpoints, handle JSON data, and use HTTP methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "-  Rich Ecosystem and Extensions\n",
        "There are many Flask extensions (like Flask-RESTful, Flask-JWT, and Flask-SQLAlchemy) that add functionality when you need it.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Great for Prototyping and Microservices\n",
        "Fast setup and small footprint make Flask perfect for rapid prototyping or building microservices.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  What is routing in Flask?\n",
        " - Routing in Flask refers to the process of mapping URLs (routes) to Python functions that handle the requests. In other words, routing defines what happens when a user accesses a specific URL in your Flask application.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  How do you create a simple Flask application?\n",
        " - Creating a simple Flask application is straightforward. Here’s a step-by-step guide to build and run your first basic Flask app.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Step 1: Install Flask\n",
        "Make sure Python is installed, then install Flask using pip:\n",
        "\n",
        "pip install flask\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Step 2: Create the Flask App\n",
        "Create a file named app.py (you can name it anything).\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "# app.py\n",
        "from flask import Flask\n",
        "\n",
        "app = Flask(__name__)  # Create the Flask application\n",
        "\n",
        "@app.route('/')  # Define the route for the homepage\n",
        "def home():\n",
        "    return \"Hello, Flask!\"  # Return a simple response\n",
        "\n",
        "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
        "    app.run(debug=True)  # Start the server in debug mode\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Step 3: Run the Application\n",
        "In the terminal, run:\n",
        "\n",
        "bash\n",
        "python app.py\n",
        "You should see output like:\n",
        "\n",
        "csharp\n",
        " * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)\n",
        "Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ — you’ll see \"Hello, Flask!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What are HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs?\n",
        " - In RESTful APIs, HTTP methods (also called HTTP verbs) define the type of operation to be performed on resources. These methods correspond to the basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are the main HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs:\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 1. GET\n",
        "Purpose: Retrieve data from the server.\n",
        "\n",
        "Used For: Reading a resource or a list of resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "Safe and idempotent (does not modify the resource).\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "GET /users → Get a list of users\n",
        "GET /users/123 → Get user with ID 123\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 2. POST\n",
        "Purpose: Create a new resource.\n",
        "\n",
        "Used For: Submitting data to be processed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Not idempotent (multiple requests can create multiple resources).\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "POST /users → Create a new user with data in the request body\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 3. PUT\n",
        "Purpose: Update a resource completely.\n",
        "\n",
        "Used For: Replacing an existing resource with new data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Idempotent (same request yields the same result).\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "PUT /users/123 → Replace the entire user data for user with ID 123\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 4. PATCH\n",
        "Purpose: Partially update a resource.\n",
        "\n",
        "Used For: Updating only specified fields.\n",
        "\n",
        "Idempotent, like PUT.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "PATCH /users/123 → Update only the email field of user 123\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 5. DELETE\n",
        "Purpose: Remove a resource.\n",
        "\n",
        "Used For: Deleting data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Idempotent.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "DELETE /users/123 → Delete user with ID 123\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask?\n",
        " -  Purpose of @app.route():\n",
        "\n",
        "- Defines Routes\n",
        "\n",
        "Maps specific URLs to Python functions (called view functions).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Handles HTTP Requests\n",
        "\n",
        "You can specify which HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) a route should accept:\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "@app.route('/submit', methods=['POST'])\n",
        "def submit():\n",
        "    return \"Form submitted!\"\n",
        "Supports Dynamic URLs\n",
        "Allows variables in the route:\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "@app.route('/user/<username>')\n",
        "def greet_user(username):\n",
        "    return f\"Hello, {username}!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods?\n",
        " - The GET and POST HTTP methods are two of the most commonly used methods in web development, especially in RESTful APIs and web forms. They serve different purposes and have key differences in how they send data and how they're used.\n",
        "\n",
        " 🔹 GET Method\n",
        "\n",
        "  Purpose:\n",
        "Retrieve (read) data from the server.\n",
        "\n",
        " Characteristics:\n",
        "\n",
        "Data is sent in the URL as query parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: GET /search?query=flask\n",
        "\n",
        "Idempotent: Making the same request multiple times gives the same result.\n",
        "\n",
        "Safe: It does not modify any data on the server.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cached by browsers: Responses can be stored and reused.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bookmarkable: URLs with query parameters can be saved and shared.\n",
        "\n",
        "Limited data size (because of URL length limits).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "POST Method\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose:\n",
        "Submit (create or send) data to the server.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Characteristics:\n",
        "\n",
        "Data is sent in the request body, not in the URL.\n",
        "\n",
        "Not idempotent: Making the same request multiple times can have side effects (like creating multiple records).\n",
        "\n",
        "Used to change server state (e.g., create a new user, submit a form).\n",
        "\n",
        "Not cached by default.\n",
        "\n",
        "Supports larger payloads than GET.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. How do you handle errors in Flask APIs?\n",
        " - Handling errors in Flask APIs is important to ensure your application responds gracefully and communicates issues clearly to clients. Flask provides multiple ways to handle errors, both automatically and customized.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.  How do you connect Flask to a SQL database?\n",
        " - To connect Flask to a SQL database, you typically use a library like SQLAlchemy, which is a powerful Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for Python. Flask also provides an integration layer called Flask-SQLAlchemy to simplify this process.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " ✅ Step-by-Step: Connecting Flask to a SQL Database\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 1. Install Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy\n",

        "\n",
        "🔹 2. Set Up Your Flask App and Database\n",
        "Create a file called app.py:\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "from flask import Flask\n",
        "from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy\n",
        "\n",
        "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
        "\n",
        "# Configure the database URI (here using SQLite)\n",
        "app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///mydatabase.db'\n",
        "app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False\n",
        "\n",
        "# Initialize the database object\n",
        "db = SQLAlchemy(app)\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 3. Define Your Models (Tables)\n",
        "python\n",
        "class User(db.Model):\n",
        "    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n",
        "    name = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)\n",
        "    email = db.Column(db.String(120), unique=True, nullable=False)\n",
        "\n",
        "    def __repr__(self):\n",
        "        return f'<User {self.name}>'\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 4. Create the Database Tables\n",
        "Run this once to create your database file and tables:\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "with app.app_context():\n",
        "    db.create_all()\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 5. Add and Query Data\n",
        "python\n",
        "@app.route('/add_user')\n",
        "def add_user():\n",
        "    user = User(name='Alice', email='alice@example.com')\n",
        "    db.session.add(user)\n",
        "    db.session.commit()\n",
        "    return f\"Added user {user.name}\"\n",
        "\n",
        "@app.route('/users')\n",
        "def get_users():\n",
        "    users = User.query.all()\n",
        "    return { \"users\": [user.name for user in users] }\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the role of Flask-SQLAlchemy?\n",
        " - Role of Flask-SQLAlchemy:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Integrates SQLAlchemy with Flask\n",
        "\n",
        "It bridges SQLAlchemy and Flask, making it easy to set up database connections and use ORM features within Flask apps.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Simplifies Configuration\n",
        "\n",
        "Handles common Flask-specific setup like configuration from Flask’s app.config and managing the application context.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Provides ORM Capabilities\n",
        "\n",
        "Lets you define Python classes (models) that map to database tables, enabling you to interact with the database using Python objects instead of raw SQL.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Manages Database Sessions\n",
        "\n",
        "Takes care of creating and managing database sessions, so you don’t have to manually manage connections or transactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Supports Multiple Databases\n",
        "\n",
        "Works seamlessly with SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and more, through SQLAlchemy’s dialect system.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Facilitates Database Migrations\n",
        "\n",
        "When combined with tools like Flask-Migrate, it supports smooth schema migrations.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are Flask blueprints, and how are they useful?\n",
        " - Flask Blueprints are a way to organize your Flask application into smaller, reusable, and modular components. Think of them as mini applications or “sub-apps” that group related routes, templates, and static files.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why Are Blueprints Useful?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Modularity\n",
        "\n",
        "Split your app into distinct modules, e.g., auth, blog, admin, each with its own routes.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- Code Reusability\n",
        "\n",
        "Blueprints can be reused across different projects or shared within a project.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Simplifies Large Projects\n",
        "\n",
        "Keeps the codebase clean and maintainable.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Supports Multiple Instances\n",
        "\n",
        "You can register the same blueprint multiple times with different URL prefixes.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the purpose of Flask's request object?\n",
        " - Purpose of Flask’s request object:\n",
        "\n",
        "It allows you to access all data sent by the client as part of the request, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Request data (form data, JSON, query parameters)\n",
        "\n",
        "- HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)\n",
        "\n",
        "- Headers (e.g., content type, authorization)\n",
        "\n",
        "- Cookies\n",
        "\n",
        "- Files uploaded via forms\n",
        "\n",
        "- URL information\n",
        "\n",
        "14.  How do you create a RESTful API endpoint using Flask?\n",
        " - Creating a RESTful API endpoint in Flask involves defining routes that respond to HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and returning data (usually JSON) in a structured way.\n",
        "\n",
        " How it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "- GET /api/items — Returns all items.\n",
        "\n",
        "- POST /api/items — Creates a new item (expects JSON body like {\"name\": \"New Item\"}).\n",
        "\n",
        "- GET /api/items/<item_id> — Returns item by id.\n",
        "\n",
        "- PUT /api/items/<item_id> — Updates the item by id.\n",
        "\n",
        "- DELETE /api/items/<item_id> — Deletes the item by id.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is the purpose of Flask's jsonify() function?\n",
        " - Flask's jsonify() function is used to convert Python data structures into a JSON-formatted HTTP response that Flask can send back to the client.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why use jsonify()?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Automatic JSON conversion: It takes Python dictionaries, lists, or other serializable objects and converts them into a JSON string.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Sets the correct content-type: It automatically sets the HTTP response header Content-Type to application/json, so the client knows the response is JSON.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Handles encoding: It takes care of properly encoding Unicode and special characters.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Creates a Flask Response object: So you don't have to manually create the response.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. Explain Flask’s url_for() function?\n",
        " - Flask’s url_for() function is a very handy utility that helps you build URLs dynamically for your Flask routes (endpoints) based on the function name, rather than hardcoding the URL paths as strings.\n",
        "\n",
        " What does url_for() do?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Takes the name of a view function (the function that handles a route) and generates the corresponding URL.\n",
        "\n",
        "- You can also pass keyword arguments to fill in dynamic parts of the URL.\n",
        "\n",
        "- This makes your code more maintainable because if you ever change the URL pattern of a route, you don’t have to search and replace URLs everywhere — just the route decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. How does Flask handle static files (CSS, JavaScript, etc.)?\n",
        " - Flask has built-in support for serving static files like CSS, JavaScript, images, and other assets.\n",
        "\n",
        "How Flask handles static files:\n",
        "- Default folder:\n",
        "\n",
        "By convention, Flask looks for static files in a folder named static located at the root of your Flask project (next to your main app file).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Accessing static files:\n",
        "Static files inside the static folder are served automatically under the /static URL path.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Referencing static files in templates:\n",
        "You should use Flask’s url_for() to generate URLs for static files, so the URLs are always correct regardless of deployment path.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is an API specification, and how does it help in building a Flask API?\n",
        " - An API specification is a formal, structured document that defines how an API behaves, what endpoints it offers, what inputs it expects, and what outputs it returns. It acts as a blueprint or contract between the API provider and consumers (developers, applications).\n",
        "\n",
        " How does an API specification help when building a Flask API?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Clear contract:\n",
        "\n",
        "It clearly defines what your API should do, making implementation focused and consistent.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Design-first development:\n",
        "\n",
        "You can design the API spec first, then implement the Flask endpoints to match it.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Documentation:\n",
        "\n",
        "The spec can be used to automatically generate interactive API docs (e.g., Swagger UI) for users and testers.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Client generation:\n",
        "\n",
        "Tools can generate client libraries in multiple languages from the spec, easing integration.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Validation:\n",
        "\n",
        "You can validate incoming requests and outgoing responses against the spec to ensure correctness.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Collaboration:\n",
        "\n",
        "Helps backend developers, frontend developers, testers, and other stakeholders stay aligned.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What are HTTP status codes, and why are they important in a Flask API?\n",
        " - HTTP status codes are standardized 3-digit numbers sent by a server in response to an HTTP request. They indicate the outcome of the request—whether it succeeded, failed, or something else.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why are HTTP status codes important in a Flask API?\n",
        "\n",
        "They communicate the result of the client’s request clearly and consistently.\n",
